# PHP-jQuery-DCC-Empire-of-the-East-Zero-Level-Character-Generator
The Dungeon Crawl Classics Empire of the East Zero Level Character Generator has been designed primarily with PHP and jQuery. Several of the jQuery/JavaScript functions are stored in external files, as a means of creating greater design efficiency, with the goal of writing a program with high cohesion and low coupling. In this way, this program simulates Object-Oriented design. JSON is used to store multi-column variables, with jQuery functions used to retrieve these variables.
